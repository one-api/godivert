# GoDivert

A high-performance, pure Go implementation of the [WinDivert](https://github.com/basil00/WinDivert) and [FastDivert](https://github.com/one-api/FastDivert)(WIP) user-mode library.

GoDivert allows you to capture and inject network packets on Windows without the complexity of CGO or external C
dependencies. It is designed for high-performance network monitoring, security, and traffic engineering.

## Key Features

- **🚀 Zero CGO Dependency**: Built entirely in pure Go using `golang.org/x/sys/windows`. No GCC or MinGW required.
- **🐹 Idiomatic Go**: Designed with a Go-first mentality, featuring friendly error handling and structured types.
- **📦 Embedded Driver**: Bundles WinDivert drivers directly into your binary using `go:embed`.
- **⚡ High Performance**: Optimized driver interaction for low-latency packet processing.
- **🔍 Pure Go Filter Compiler**: Includes a complete filter compiler implemented in Go.

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/one-api/godivert"
)

func main() {
	// Open driver with a filter
	divert, err := godivert.New("!loopback and (tcp or udp)", godivert.LayerNetwork, 0, 0)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer divert.Close()

	// Buffer for packet data
	packet := make([]byte, 2000)
	var addr godivert.Address

	// Recv Send Loop
	for i := 0; ; i++ {
		readLen, err := divert.Recv(packet, &addr)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
		_, err = divert.Send(packet[:readLen], &addr)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	}
}

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This library requires **Administrator Privileges** to run as it interacts with the Windows kernel.

## Examples

GoDivert comes with several real-world examples under the [examples/](examples/) directory. These
showcase how to use GoDivert for advanced network engineering, security, and performance analysis.

### 1. Network Bandwidth Limiter & Latency Shaper

Simulates poor network conditions (artificial latency, packet loss, and traffic rate-limiting) on specific IP/UDP/TCP
traffic.

* **Use Case**: Testing multiplayer games or mobile APIs under bad network conditions (similar to a programmatic,
  lightweight CLI version of Clumsy).
* **How to run**:
  ```bash
  # Inject 100ms latency, 5% packet loss, and limit speed to 256 KB/s
  go run ./examples/bandwidth_limiter -latency 100 -loss 5.0 -bandwidth 256
  ```

### 2. DNS Sinkhole & Spoofing Firewall

A packet-level DNS firewall. Intercepts outbound DNS queries, parses the queried domain names, and blocks/spoofs queries
matching an ad/tracking blocklist to `127.0.0.1` / `::` instantly.

* **Use Case**: Building custom network-wide ad-blockers or security gateways without modifying DNS settings or starting
  a DNS server daemon.
* **How to run**:
  ```bash
  go run ./examples/dns_sinkhole
  ```

### 3. Live Process Connection & Traffic Flow Monitor

Monitors active TCP/UDP connections in real-time, resolves Windows process IDs (PIDs) to their process image names (e.g.
`chrome.exe`, `spotify.exe`), and renders an interactive, colored terminal dashboard.

* **Use Case**: Gaining complete, light-weight process-level network traffic visibility without bulky packet-capture
  libraries.
* **How to run**:
  ```bash
  go run ./examples/flow_monitor
  ```

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
go test ./...
```
